## Intel® System Studio
> The explosion of connected smart devices – expected to reach 50 billion by 2020 – is driving unprecedented need for efficient tools to meet shorter development cycles for system software and embedded c applications.
Intel® System Studio 2015 does exactly that, enabling developers to get the most out of Intel® architecture-based systems and embedded applications.
Intel® System Studio 2015 is a comprehensive and integrated tool suite that provides developers with advanced system tools and technologies to help accelerate the delivery of the next-generation, energy-efficient, high-performance, and reliable embedded and mobile devices.
Intel® System Studio is a fully validated and Intel-supported product optimized for Intel® architecture, while being compatible with open source technologies.

# Operating Systems

## Yocto
> It's not an embedded Linux distribution – it creates a custom one for you. The Yocto Project is an open source collaboration project that provides templates, tools and methods to help you create custom Linux-based systems for embedded products regardless of the hardware architecture. It was founded in 2010 as a collaboration among many hardware manufacturers, open-source operating systems vendors, and electronics companies to bring some order to the chaos of embedded Linux development.

## Ubilinux
> ubilinux™ is an embedded Linux distribution from Emutex and is based on Debian "Wheezy". It is targeted at embedded devices that have limited memory and storage capabilities.
